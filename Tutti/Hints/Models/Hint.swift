 A hint is a simple message that is intended to be displayed
 once. It's perfect for quick onboarding, like showing users
 how certain parts of a UI works.
 
 When presenting hints, use the present function of the hint
 and not the presenter. The presenter ignores any rules that
 applies to the hint.
